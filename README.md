# ML-Based Deadlock Detection System

A machine learning-based deadlock detection system that compares performance across different algorithms with comprehensive timing analysis, specifically designed for banking transaction data.

## 🚀 Features

### ML Algorithms Comparison
- **Hybrid Model** - Intelligent method selection with optimized performance
- **Random Forest** - Ensemble tree-based classifier
- **XGBoost** - Gradient boosting optimized for performance  

### How to Use:

- Upload your transaction data (Excel/CSV)
- Select detection methods to compare    
- Run the analysis
- View deadlock detection results

### Expected Data Format:

-Your file should contain transaction details like:
    Account information
    Transaction amounts
    Transaction types
    Timestamps
